To Do

    - Maybe prune should delete failed files?
    - Show help when no arguments are used
    - When scanning, show newly found files
    - Make PyInstaller compatible (embed the browser?)

Done

    - Added prune functionality
    - Check if we need to update the database between downloads (in case of a crash) instead of at the end
    - Create folders on demand (only if they are needed)

    - Backed up old Chancho versions in branches
